# Right-to-Save
Campaign to include "Right to access means to store value" as a fundamental human right

This is a campaign to include "Right to freely access means to store value" as a fundamental human right.

In many countries around the world, citizens have restricted access to tools that serve as store of value such as:

- Developed nations fiat currency like US dollars, Euro, etc. Mainly due to local currency exchange controls, developed countries banking restrictions (cost to open and maintain account, restrictions on opening bank account to tourists, etc), travel restrictions (visas, travel cost), or 
- Non-inflationary assets like real estate, commodities, etc. Mainly due to minimum investment requirements to acquire these assets.

Limited access to "store of value" tools limits savings capacity, and therefore perpetuates poverty cycle. 

Having "right to freely access means to store value" as part of the Human Rights lists would help society could use this leverage to push countries around the world to ensure their citizens have free access to real savings tools.
