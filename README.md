# Right-to-Save as a "Fundamental Human Right"

Goal:
We want to include "right to access means to store value" as part of the fundamental human rights list.

Problem:
In many countries around the world, citizens have restricted access to tools that serve as a store of value, therefore limiting citizens savings capacity and perpetuating the poverty cycle.

Solution:
Having "right to freely access means to store value" as part of the Human Rights lists would push countries around the world to ensure their citizens have real access to real savings tools.

Background:
From my experience growing up in Venezuela, only the most privileged segment of the population has access to effective store of value tools.

- Local Banking access: being locally banked does not provide a feasible store of value solution given the negative real interest rate (high inflation rate > savings bank account interest rate).

- Foreign fiat currencies (stable): Government imposed currency exchange controls prevent regular citizens from legally accessing foreign governments fiat currencies (usd, euro, etc) as an alternative tool to store value. As a result, a small segment of the population resorts to black market to access foreign fiat currencies. 

The least privileged segment of this group can only access and hold cash, which is difficult to store safely and is highly vulnerable to fraud (fake bills, counterparty failing to commit, etc). As any black market, lack of information and high risk prevents a big segment of population from participating.

Only the most privileged segment has access to foreign currency bank accounts due to additional costs and difficulties including:
          Travel restrictions (travel visas),
          Language restrictions,
          Paying for flights,
          Providing paperwork required to open a bank account as foreigner (e.g. student visa, address and phone # in foreign country...), 
          Providing minimum capital required to open and maintain bank account, 
          Staying long enough to receive debit card (no debit card international shipping), etc...

- Non-inflationary assets such as real estate: only accessible to the most privileged segment of the population mainly due to minimum investment requirements to acquire these assets.

- Highly depreciable "assets" (cars, motorcycles, appliances, etc): highly depreciable items are used as last resource store of value tool by a segment of the population that is internationally unbanked and unwilling or incapable of accessing black market for foreign fiat currency cash.
